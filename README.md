# 1️⃣ First project 
This project is inspired by Kacper Sieradziński "PODSTAWY PYTHONA: CZTERY INSPIRUJĄCE PROJEKTY DLA POCZĄTKUJĄCYCH!" 🐍

I would like to develop and modify an existing project and add new functions as a learning experience. 

In the tutorial the game involves moving around the board and finding the key 🗝

'Cold' and 'warm' hints are used to help guess the location of the key.  

If we step outside the box of the board the message "You hit the wall" is displayed.

If you enter the field where the key is hidden the message "the key is yours. you can open the treasure" is displayed . Original code below :

My project will be **modified** to learn python on this example.

I will create two variables: **the diamond 💎 and the knife 🔪**. 

If the player enters the field with the diamond, he wins.🏆🏆

If he stands on the field with the knife, he loses a life.❌

The player will have **5 lives**.
